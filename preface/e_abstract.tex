In recent decades, aerial robots, especially small rotary-wing UAVs, have made great improvements in structure, flight characteristics and navigation control, and the trajectory planning methods suitable for UAVs have also made great progress. In this paper, a UAV trajectory planning method based on flight corridor is proposed. On the basis of solving trajectory polynomial parameters using flight corridor, an order optimization strategy for Bessel curve is designed to reduce the parameters to be solved. The main contents and implementation methods are as follows:
